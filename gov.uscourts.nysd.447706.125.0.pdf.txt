                 Re:    Giuffre v. Maxwe ,
                        Case no. 15-cv-07433-RWS - Regarding Protective Order

         Dear Judge Sweet:

                This is a letter motion to file Ms. Giuffre's Non-Redacted Reply in Support of Motion for
         Forensic Examination ("Reply Brief') and certain accompanying exhibits under seal pursuant to
         this Court's March 18, 2016, Protective Order and the Southern District of New York Electronic
         Case Filing Rules & Instructions 6.2.

         The Protective Order states:

                Whenever a party seeks to file any document or material containing CONFIDENTIAL
                INFORMATION with the Court in this matter, it shall be accompanied by a Motion to
                Seal pursuant to Section 6.2 of the Electronic Case Filing Rules & Instructions for the
                Southern District of New York.

         See Protective Order [DE 62] signed on March 17, 2016, at p. 4. Defendants have designated
         certain documents as Confidential Information and have designated Defendant's entire
         deposition testimony as confidential. Ms. Giuffre takes no position at this time on whether
         Defendant' s designations are proper. Because of the Protective Order, however, Ms. Giuffre
         believes that she cannot presently produce or reference such documents in public court filings.
         Accordingly, as Ms. Giuffre' s Reply Brief contains material that Defendant has designated as
         confidential, she seeks leave to file the Non-Redacted Reply Brief and certain related exhibits
         under seal.

                                                      Respectfully submitted,

                                                       ~~                          ,/

                                                    /;ig~ Mc;:~.
