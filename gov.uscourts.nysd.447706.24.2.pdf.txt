  Statement on Behalf of Ghislaine Maxwell

        Share



  LONDON, March 10, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- Ghislaine Maxwell denies the various allegations about her that have appeared
  recently in the media. These allegations are all entirely false.                                                                          Journalists and Bloggers
  It is unacceptable that letters sent by Ms Maxwell's legal representatives to certain newspapers pointing out the truth and asking
  for the allegations to be withdrawn have simply been ignored.

  In the circumstances, Ms Maxwell is now proceeding to take legal action against those newspapers.

  "I understand newspapers need stories to sell copies. It is well known that certain newspapers live by the adage, "why let the truth      Visit PR Newswire for
  get in the way of a good story." However, the allegations made against me are abhorrent and entirely untrue and I ask that they           Journalists for releases, photos
  stop," said Ghislaine Maxwell.                                                                                                            and customised feeds just for

  "A number of newspapers have shown a complete lack of accuracy in their reporting of this story and a failure to carry out the
  most elementary investigation or any real due diligence. I am now taking action to clear my name," she said.                              View and download archived
