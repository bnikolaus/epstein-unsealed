                               United States District Court
                              Southern District of New York


Virginia L. Giuffre,

               Plaintiff,                     Case No.: 15-cv-07433-RWS

v.

Ghislaine Maxwell,

            Defendant.
________________________________/

PLAIINTIFF, VIRGINIA L. GIUFFRE’S NOTICE OF SUPPLEMENTAL AUTHORITY

       In further support of her Opposition to Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss the Complaint,

Plaintiff Virginia L. Giuffre, by and through her undersigned counsel, respectfully submits the

recent decision in Green v. Cosby, 3:14-cv-30211-MGM, 2015 WL 5923553 (D. Mass., Oct. 15,

2015) (“Cosby”) (attached as Exhibit A).

       In Cosby, the court denied Bill Cosby’s motion to dismiss the sexual assault victim’s

defamation complaint, holding that Cosby’s “suggestion that Plaintiff intentionally lied about

being sexually assaulted” could expose plaintiff to “‘scorn or ridicule,” and, therefore, Cosby’s

statement could be found to have a “defamatory meaning.” Green v. Cosby, No. CV 14-30211-

MGM, 2015 WL 5923553, at *11 (D. Mass. Oct. 9, 2015).

       The Cosby decision is relevant to arguments advanced by Defendant in support of her

motion to dismiss, and therefore, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court take notice of this

supplemental authority.
