Footnotes
1      When the court granted leave for Plaintiffs to file the SAC, the court simultaneously afforded Defendant the opportunity
       to “file a motion to dismiss which responds to the newly amended complaint, or which supplements the [motions to
       dismiss] previously filed.” (Dkt. No. 46.) Defendant notified the court of his continued reliance on previously-filed
       submissions. (Dkt No. 62, Def. Letter/request (non-motion).) Accordingly, the court evaluates Defendant’s
       previously-filed motions to dismiss, and arguments in support thereof, in relation to Plaintiffs’ SAC.
2      The court’s factual summary includes an abbreviated version of those facts alleged by Plaintiffs. The court also makes
       use of the full text versions of the allegedly defamatory statements. For three of those statements, the court utilizes full
       text versions provided by Defendant as exhibits to his memorandum in support of his motions. (Dkt. No. 25, Decl. re:
       Mem. Supp. Mot. to Dismiss, Exs. A, D, F.) Plaintiffs have not contested the accuracy of the full versions of these
       statements provided by Defendant and the court considers them as “documents sufficiently referred to in the
       complaint” and as “central to plaintiffs’ claims.” See Watterson v. Page, 987 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1993); see also Fudge v.
       Penthouse Int’l, Ltd., 840 F.2d 1012, 1015 (1st Cir.1988) (affirming District Court’s decision, under similar
       circumstances, to consider a copy of the article submitted by the defendant which had formed the basis of the
       defamation action, as it was central to the plaintiff’s complaint). Additionally, the court uses the full text version of a
       fourth statement provided by Plaintiffs as an exhibit to their motion for leave to file their SAC. (Dkt. No. 20, Pls.’ Mem.
       Supp. re: Mot. for Leave to File Second Am. Compl., Ex. C.)
3      While Plaintiff Serignese is not specific as to how or where this allegation was disclosed (see SAC ¶ 50), Defendant
       states that it was disclosed to the Huffington Post. (Dkt. No. 24, Def.’s Mem. Supp. Mots. to Dismiss (“Def.’s Mem.”) 5
       (citing SAC ¶ 48).) Defendant has attached a document which he asserts to be the Huffington Post article in question.
       (Decl. re: Mot. to Dismiss, Ex. C.) Plaintiff Serignese has not offered a conflicting explanation.
4      In the SAC, Plaintiffs describe two of the individuals who issued the statements as doing so while an “agent, authorized
       representative, lawyer, servant, and/or employee” of Defendant and one as doing so while an “agent, authorized
       representative, servant, and/or employee” of Defendant. (SAC ¶¶ 26, 29, 53.) As any distinctions among the meanings
       of these terms are not material at this stage, throughout this opinion the court refers to these individuals as Defendant’s
       “agents.”
5      The court will refer to these responsive statements, collectively, as the “Washington Post Statement.”

6      The parties have not provided the court with a copy of the original, uncorrected version of the November 22, 2014
       Washington Post Online Article.
7      Defendant, in turn, has also provided the court with a copy of the correction notice issued with respect to the print
       edition and dated December 12, 2014. (Dkt. No. 28, Decl. re: Opp. to Pls.’ Mot. for Leave to File Second Am. Compl.,
       Ex. 1.) It reads in its entirety: “1A Nov. 23 Page One article about the allegations of sexual assault against Bill Cosby
       misstated the timing of a statement of denial issued by an attorney for Cosby. The statement denying Tamara Green’s
       allegations was issued by lawyer Walter M. Phillips Jr. when Green’s allegations first surfaced in 2005, not in the week
       before the article was published.” (Id. at 2.)

8      As mentioned, the correction notice issued with respect to the November 23, 2014 Washington Post Print Article,
       provided by Defendant, is worded slightly differently than the correction notice for the November 22, 2014 Washington
       Post Online Article used by Plaintiff. (See Dkt. 28, Decl. re: Opp. to Pls.’ Mot. for Leave to File Second Am. Compl., Ex.
       1; Mem. re: Mot. to Am., Ex. C) The court generally limits its discussion to the correction with respect to the online
       article, as that correction is treated as an attachment to the complaint, but recognizes both corrections make the same
       operative point.
9      Plaintiffs also argue the court may not take judicial notice of the correction because Defendant is attempting to use it to
       prove the truth of the matter asserted therein, i.e., that Phillips in fact provided his statement in 2005, not in 2014. See,
       e.g., Kosilek v. Spencer, 889 F.Supp.2d 190, 215 n. 6 (D.Mass.2012), aff’d, 740 F.3d 733 (1st Cir.2014), rev’d en banc
       on other grounds, 774 F.3d 63 (1st Cir.2014). The court is not taking judicial notice of the correction pursuant to Rule
       201 of the Federal Rules of Evidence because Plaintiffs used it to support their motion to amend and relied on it in their
       SAC, effectively attaching it to their complaint. Accordingly, this limitation (documents judicially noticed under Rule 201
       may not be considered for the truth of the matter asserted) is a non-issue. See, e.g., Papadopoulos v. Amaker, No.
       12–CV–3608 (DLI)(RLM), 2013 WL 3226757, at *1 n. 1 (E.D.N.Y. June 25, 2013).
10     The court notes that, if it were to consider both the online and print versions of the correction notices, the slightly
       different wording between the two, which may well be innocuous, could arguably raise questions about the manner in
       which the Washington Post came to include the Phillips statement in the article, further demonstrating the benefit in
       allowing the parties to engage the discovery process to seek clarification of these factual issues; the need for fact
       clarification is not a basis for dismissal at this stage.
11     California has adopted the Uniform Single Publication Act, codifying the single publication rule at Cal. Civ. Code §
       3425.3. That section provides:
            No person shall have more than one cause of action for damages for libel or slander or invasion of privacy or any
            other tort founded upon any single publication or exhibition or utterance, such as any one issue of a newspaper or
            book or magazine or any one presentation to an audience or any one broadcast over radio or television or any one
            exhibition of a motion picture. Recovery in any action shall include all damages for any such tort suffered by the
            plaintiff in all jurisdictions.
12     Relevant differences which may exist between California and Florida law regarding defamation are addressed as
       applicable throughout this Discussion.
13     Defendant makes this argument as to the Newsweek Statement, the November 20, 2014 Statement, and the
       November 21, 2014 Statement, but not as to the Washington Post Statement.
14     Defendant suggests California’s treatment of “predictable opinion” is similar to a “self-defense privilege.” One obvious
       difference is that the phrase “predictable opinion” is used to describe a type of statement that is not defamatory
       because it does not assert a fact capable of being proved true or false, while a self-defense privilege, in the defamation
       context, generally prevents what may be a defamatory statement from being the basis for a defamation suit because of
       a specific exception under state law.
15     Defendant’s contention that Plaintiff Traitz has offered no corroboration is, at least arguably, factually inaccurate
       because of the multiplicity of similar claims, a fact acknowledged in Defendant’s statements of November 20th and
       21st. The similar claims could be considered by a fact finder as a form of corroboration by a recognizably unique
       pattern of conduct.
16     In the SAC, Plaintiffs specifically allege Defendant is liable for the statements given by his agents on the basis of
       respondeat superior. (SAC ¶¶ 83, 94, 105.)
17     Defendant nonetheless asserts statements made in self-defense fall within the “predictable opinion” doctrine
       recognized in California. This court, however, has already rejected Defendant’s predictable opinion arguments. See
       Section V.C.1.a.ii., supra. Accordingly, his predictable opinion arguments fare no better here when linked to a
       purported self-defense privilege.
18     Arguably, a self-defense privilege could protect a defendant who made a responsive good faith statement that later
       turned out to be inaccurate. See Sack on Defamation § 9:1, at 9-3 & n.6.

19     The court notes that in some states, a defendant’s negligence in ascertaining the truth of a conditionally privileged
       defamatory statement may constitute grounds for losing the privilege. See Sack on Defamation § 9:3.4, at 9-52 to 9-53.

          Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 26-1 Filed 01/08/16 Page 26 of 26




Green v. Cosby, --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2015)



       Under the Supreme Court’s decision in Gertz, 418 U.S. 323, 94 S.Ct. 2997, 41 L.Ed.2d 789, however, each state’s
       defamation law must include an element of fault at least rising to negligence; therefore, “[e]stablishing the cause of
       action would, ipso facto, establish defeasance of qualified privilege.” Sack on Defamation § 9:3.4, at 9-53. In any event,
       the court need not delve further into the complications surrounding a self-defense privilege, the ways in which it may be
       lost, and the tensions with the motion to dismiss standard, because neither California nor Florida recognizes the
       self-defense privilege.
20     The libel-proof plaintiff doctrine, in contrast, looks to a plaintiff’s previously damaged reputation. See Tel. Publ’g Co.,
       929 A.2d at 1002–04 (explaining the differences between the incremental harm and libel-proof plaintiff doctrines).
       Under that doctrine, “when a plaintiff’s reputation is so diminished at the time of publication of the allegedly defamatory
       material that only nominal damages at most could be awarded because the person’s reputation was not capable of
       sustaining further harm, the plaintiff is deemed to be libel-proof as a matter of law and is not permitted to burden a
       defendant with a trial.” Lamb v. Rizzo, 391 F.3d 1133, 1137 (10th Cir.2004) (internal citation omitted); see Tel. Publ’g
       Co., 929 A.2d at 1005 (“To justify applying the doctrine, the evidence of record must show not only that the plaintiff
       engaged in criminal or anti-social behavior in the past, but also that his activities were widely reported to the public.”
       (internal citation omitted)). As Plaintiffs note, Defendant has only expressly requested dismissal pursuant to the
       incremental harm doctrine, and not the separate libel-proof plaintiff doctrine. However, even if Defendant were pressing
       both grounds for dismissal, his argument would fail because Florida has not adopted the libel-proof plaintiff doctrine,
       see Klayman, 2015 WL 1546173, at *17 n. 18, and Defendant has not established that Traitz falls into the narrow
       category of individuals with a sufficiently tarnished reputation such that a defamatory statement could not impair her
       reputation, see Guccione v. Hustler Magazine, Inc., 800 F.2d 298, 303 (2d Cir.1986) (“The libel-proof plaintiff doctrine
       is to be applied with caution ... since few plaintiffs will have so bad a reputation that they are not entitled to obtain
       redress for defamatory statements.” (citation omitted)); Church of Scientology Int’l v. Time Warner, Inc., 932 F.Supp.
       589, 594 (S.D.N.Y.1996) (“Dismissal based on the libel-proof plaintiff doctrine is not appropriate at this stage of the
       litigation, because it requires the Court to make factual findings regarding plaintiff’s reputation for a particular trait.”).
