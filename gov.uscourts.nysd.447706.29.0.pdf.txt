VIRGINIA L. GIUFFRE,

        PLAINTIFF,                                                                                         DEFENDANT’S NOTICE OF
V.                                                                                                        SUPPLEMENTAL AUTHORITY
GHISLAINE MAXWELL,                                                                                             15-cv-07433-RWS
        DEFENDANT.


  --------------------------------------------------X

        In further support of her Motion to Dismiss the Complaint, Defendant Ghislaine

Maxwell, through her attorney Laura A. Menninger of the law firm Haddon, Morgan and

Foreman, P.C., hereby respectfully submits the recent decision in Hill v. Cosby, 15 cv 1658

(W.D. Pa. January 21, 2016).

        In Hill v. Cosby, the court dismissed, with prejudice, what it found to be a “very detailed

and complete Complaint1” alleging, among other things, that Cosby defamed an alleged sexual

assault victim by issuing statements to the press describing the allegations against him as

“unsubstantiated, fantastical stories…[that] have escalated far past the point of absurdity.” (Ex.

A at 8).    Citing Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U.S. 323, 339 (1974), the court held that “[t]his

sort of purely opnionated speech…is protected and not actionable as defamatory speech.” Id. In

dismissing the case, the court further noted that Cosby’s public denial of the claims against him

was a “legal position” that does not “lead to an inference that Plaintiff is a ‘liar and an

extortionist.’” Id. at 8, 12.


        1
       In fact, the full text of each allegedly defamatory statement was set forth in the
Complaint. (Ex. A at 8).

       The facts and arguments set forth in Hill v. Cosby are analogous to those here, and thus

this newly issued decision is relevant to the arguments advanced by Ms. Maxwell in support of

her Motion to Dismiss. Ms. Maxwell therefore respectfully requests that the Court take notice of

this supplemental authority.



Dated: January 22, 2016.
