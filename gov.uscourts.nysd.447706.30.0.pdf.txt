                                United States District Court
                               Southern District of New York


Virginia L. Giuffre,

               Plaintiff,                      Case No.: 15-cv-07433-RWS

v.

Ghislaine Maxwell,

            Defendant.
________________________________/

                 PLAIINTIFF, VIRGINIA L. GIUFFRE’S RESPONSE
            TO DEFENDANT’S NOTICE OF SUPPLEMENTAL AUTHORITY

       In response to Defendant’s Notice of Supplemental Authority [D.E. # 29], Plaintiff

Virginia L. Giuffre, by and through her undersigned counsel, respectfully states as follows:

       As recounted by Defendant’s Notice of Supplemental Authority, the Hill Court found that

Cosby’s statements were not defamatory because they did not “lead to an inference that Plaintiff

is a ‘liar and an extortionist.’” In vivid contrast, Maxwell called Ms. Giuffre’s assertions of

sexual abuse “obvious lies.” It is axiomatic that a person telling “obvious lies” is a liar, and,

therefore, the reasoning employed by the Hill court is inapplicable to the statements made by

Maxwell.

Dated January 25, 2015

                                               Respectfully Submitted,
