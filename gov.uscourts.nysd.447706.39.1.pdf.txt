                                     PROTECTIVE ORDER

          Upon a showing of good cause in support of the entry of a protective order to

protect the discovery and dissemination of confidential information or information which

will improperly annoy, embarrass, or oppress any party, witness, or person providing

discovery in this case, IT IS ORDERED:

     1.      This Protective Order shall apply to all documents, materials, and information,

             including without limitation, documents produced, answers to interrogatories,

             responses to requests for admission, deposition testimony, and other

             information disclosed pursuant to the disclosure or discovery duties created by

             the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

     2.      As used in this Protective Order, “document” is defined as provided in

             FED.R.CIV.P. 34(a). A draft or non-identical copy is a separate document

             within the meaning of this term.

3.     Information designated “CONFIDENTIAL” shall be information that is

       confidential and implicates common law and statutory privacy interests of (a)

       plaintiff Virginia Roberts Giuffre and (b) defendant Ghislaine Maxwell.

4.     CONFIDENTIAL information shall not be disclosed or used for any purpose

       except the preparation and trial of this case.

5.     CONFIDENTIAL documents, materials, and/or information (collectively

       “CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION”) shall not, without the consent of the

       party producing it or further Order of the Court, be disclosed except that such

       information may be disclosed to:

       a. attorneys actively working on this case;

       b. persons regularly employed or associated with the attorneys actively

          working on this case whose assistance is required by said attorneys in the

          preparation for trial, at trial, or at other proceedings in this case;

       c. the parties;

       d. expert witnesses and consultants retained in connection with this

          proceeding, to the extent such disclosure is necessary for preparation, trial

          or other proceedings in this case;

       e. the Court and its employees (“Court Personnel”) in this case;

       f. stenographic reporters who are engaged in proceedings necessarily incident

          to the conduct of this action;

       g. deponents, witnesses, or potential witnesses; and

       h. other persons by written agreement of the parties.

6.     Prior to disclosing any CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION to any person

       listed above (other than counsel, persons employed by counsel, Court

       Personnel and stenographic reporters), counsel shall provide such person with

       a copy of this Protective Order and obtain from such person a written

       acknowledgment stating that he or she has read this Protective Order and

       agrees to be bound by its provisions. All such acknowledgments shall be

       retained by counsel and shall be subject to in camera review by the Court if

       good cause for review is demonstrated by opposing counsel.

7.     Documents are designated as CONFIDENTIAL by placing or affixing on them

       (in a manner that will not interfere with their legibility) the following or other

       appropriate notice: “CONFIDENTIAL.”             Discovery material designated

       CONFIDENTIAL shall be identified by Bates number. To the extent practical,

       the respective legend shall be placed near the Bates number.

8.     Designation of a document as CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION shall

       constitute a representation that such document has been reviewed by an

       attorney for the designating party, that there is a valid and good faith basis for

       such designation, made at the time of disclosure or production to the receiving

       party, and that disclosure of such information to persons other than those

       permitted access to such material would cause a privacy harm to the

       designating party.

9.      Whenever a deposition involves the disclosure of CONFIDENTIAL

        INFORMATION, the deposition or portions thereof shall be designated as

        CONFIDENTIAL and shall be subject to the provisions of this Protective

        Order. Such designation shall be made on the record during the deposition

        whenever possible, but a party may designate portions of depositions as

        CONFIDENTIAL after transcription, provided written notice of the

        designation is promptly given to all counsel of record within thirty (30) days

        after notice by the court reporter of the completion of the transcript, and until

        the expiration of such thirty (30) days after notice by the court reporter of the

        completion of the transcript, no party or counsel for any such party may share

        the contents of the deposition outside the limitations of this Protective Order.

10.     Whenever a party seeks to file any document or material containing

        CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION with the Court in this matter, it shall be

        accompanied by a Motion to Seal pursuant to Section 6.2 of the Electronic

        Case Filing Rules & Instructions for the Southern District of New York.

11.     A party may object to the designation of particular CONFIDENTIAL

        INFORMATION by giving written notice to the party designating the disputed

        information. The written notice shall identify the information to which the

        objection is made. If the parties cannot resolve the objection within ten (10)

        business days after the time the notice is received, it shall be the obligation of

        the party designating the information as CONFIDENTIAL to file an



                                           4
      Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 39-1 Filed 03/02/16 Page 6 of 7




        appropriate motion requesting that the Court determine whether the disputed

        information should be subject to the terms of this Protective Order. If such a

        motion is timely filed, the disputed information shall be treated as

        CONFIDENTIAL under the terms of this Protective Order until the Court rules

        on the motion. If the designating party fails to file such a motion within the

        prescribed time, the disputed information shall lose its designation as

        CONFIDENTIAL and shall not thereafter be treated as CONFIDENTIAL in

        accordance with this Protective Order. In connection with a motion filed under

        this provision, the party designating the information as CONFIDENTIAL shall

        bear the burden of establishing that good cause exists for the disputed

        information to be treated as CONFIDENTIAL.

12.     At the conclusion of this case, unless other arrangements are agreed upon, each

        document and all copies thereof which have been designated as

        CONFIDENTIAL shall be returned to the party that designated it

        CONFIDENTIAL, or the parties may elect to destroy CONFIDENTIAL

        documents. Where the parties agree to destroy CONFIDENTIAL documents,

        the destroying party shall provide all parties with an affidavit confirming the

        destruction.

13.     This Protective Order shall have no force and effect on the use of any

        CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION at trial in this matter.

14.     This Protective Order may be modified by the Court at any time for good cause

        shown following notice to all parties and an opportunity for them to be heard.
