                                         ARGUMENT

I.     PLAINTIFF FAILED TO COMPLY WITH HER REQUIREMENT TO
       CONFER IN GOOD FAITH PRIOR TO FILING MOTIONS TO COMPEL

       Rule 37(a)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure mandates that a motion to
compel “must include a certification that the movant has in good faith conferred or
attempted to confer with the person or party failing to make disclosure or discovery in an
effort to obtain it without court action.” (emphasis added) Notwithstanding this Rule,
Plaintiff filed two Motions to Compel (Doc. #s 33 and 35), neither of which includes the
required certification. More importantly, Plaintiff, in direct contradiction to both the
letter and spirit of Rule 37, did not make any effort to confer with Ms. Maxwell’s counsel
regarding any of the issues presented in her Motions to Compel. This significant
deficiency alone warrants the denial of both Motions. Auto. Club of New York, Inc. v.
Port Auth. Of New York & New Jersey, No. 11 CIV. 6746 RKE HBP, 2012 WL 4791804,
at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 9, 2012) (failure to make any attempts to resolve any specific
discovery disputes “alone is a sufficient ground for denying the motion [to compel]”);
Prescient Partners, L.P. v. Fieldcrest Cannon, Inc. 96-CV-7590 (DAB)(JCF), 1998 WL
67672, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 18, 1998) (“Ordinarily…a motion to compel must be denied
where the parties have failed to meet and confer.”); Dorchester Fin. Holdings Corp. v.
Banco BRJ, S.A., No. 11-CV-1529 KMW KNF, 2014 WL 3747167, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. July
28, 2014) (same).1
       The purpose of Rule 37(a)(1) is to encourage the parties to informally resolve
discovery disputes in an effort to avoid the unnecessary time and expense of motion


       1
          Indeed, during the time period in which Plaintiff was drafting her voluminous Motions
to Compel, Ms. Maxwell’s counsel was busy conferring with Plaintiff’s counsel on a number of
different discovery disputes, including location of depositions, timing of depositions, a protective
order, and Plaintiff’s responses to interrogatories. See generally Plaintiff’s Letter Motion of
February 26, 2016, Attachments (filed in contravention of this Court’s Individual Practices 1(A),
“Copies of correspondence between counsel shall not be sent to this Court.”). The product of
those conferrals was resolution of many of the parties’ issues.
                                                 1
practice and formal court hearings. See Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1993
Amendment. Here, had Plaintiff conferred with Ms. Maxwell prior to filing her motions
to compel, several issues could have been resolved without Court intervention. While
this list is by no means exhaustive, Ms. Maxwell highlights the following disputed areas
that likely could be resolved by a conferral among counsel:
       First, Plaintiff argues that the Ms. Maxwell’s privilege log is inadequate, in part
because she does not assert “that individuals such as Brett Jaffe, Philip Barden, or Martin
Weinberg represent her, or that any attorney-client relationship exists between them.”
(Mot. Compel Priv. at 13). Certainly, court intervention is unnecessary to resolve the
question of whether a certain attorney represented Ms. Maxwell at the time claimed in a
privilege log entry. Local Civil Rule 26.2 requires that for written communications, a
privilege log should include the author of the document, the addressees of the document,
and any other recipients and “where not apparent, the relationship of the author,
addressees and recipients to each other.” Neither the Local Rules nor the Federal Rules
require a privilege log to include explanation or proof that an attorney-client relationship
existed between an author and recipient of an email. In her log, Ms. Maxwell included
the names of the parties to the communication and described the relationship of the
parties. For example, in an entry for an email dated January 10, 2015, between Ms.
Maxwell and Philip Barden, Esq., Ms. Maxwell described the relationship of the parties
as “attorney/client.” If Plaintiff needed further clarification regarding that relationship,
she could have, and should have, conferred with Ms. Maxwell.2
       Second, Plaintiff takes issue with Ms. Maxwell’s objection to Plaintiff’s asserted
“Relevant Time Period” of 1999 to the present. (Mot. Compel Imp. Obj. at 4-8). On this
issue, while the parties’ respective definitions of the Relevant Time Period are currently
far apart, it is likely that the parties would be able to reach a compromised limitation for

       2
           Perhaps Plaintiff needs reminding that she has in her possession, and indeed has filed
with this Court, documents reflecting Mr. Jaffe, Mr. Barden and Mr. Cohen’s representations of
Ms. Maxwell in the course of litigation and other proceedings associated with Plaintiff’s
allegations. A conferral on this point alone will save the parties’ expense in needlessly gathering
affidavits from various attorneys and will save the Court’s time.
                                                 2
many of Plaintiff’s requests. Such a compromise would either eliminate the need for
court intervention entirely or at the very least, drastically minimize the scope of any
potential motion to compel. For example, Plaintiff’s Request No. 22 asks for “All
documents relating to calendars, schedules or appointments for you from 1999 – present.”
The overbreadth of this request is obvious. And while this Request may technically yield
relevant documents, the Request could also yield such a large volume of unrelated
documents that the balance of the production would not be “proportional to the needs of
the case.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1).
       Third, the majority of Plaintiff’s requests are presumptively overbroad. Plaintiff
routinely uses the phrases “all documents relating to” or “relating to” as part of her
requests for production of documents. See, e.g., Requests Nos. 1, 3, 6,7, 8, 10, 11, 17, 22,
23, 24, 32 and 33. Where the phrase “relating to” is not employed, Plaintiff uses equally
obtuse synonyms such as “reflecting” (Requests Nos. 34, 37) or “associated with.”
(Request No. 21).
       “Relate” is a broad term. See, e.g., WEBSTER’S NEW WORLD DICTIONARY 1198
(2d Coll. Ed. 1986) (defining “relate” to mean, inter alia, “to connect or associate, as in
thought or meaning; show as having to do with,” “to have some connection or relation
(to),” and “to have reference (to)”).   Courts have condemned the use of “related to” as
overbroad and have refused to compel a responding party to answer discovery requests
using the term. See, e.g., Meeker v. Life Care Ctrs. of Am., No. 14-CV-02101-WYD-
NYW, 2015 WL 4400533, at *4 (D. Colo. July 20, 2015) (denying motion to compel
response to interrogatory that required identification of all documents that “relate to”
drills or safety security training exercises “over a decade long span,” and holding that
interrogatory was “facially overbroad, and potentially sweep[s] in incidents that are not
proximate in location, time, and may not even be remotely of the “same type”); Avante
Int’l Tech., Inc. v. Hart Intercivic, Inc., No. CIV. 07-169-DRH, 2008 WL 2074093, at *3
(S.D. Ill. May 14, 2008) (“the court finds that the request to identify ‘all documents that
refer or relate to each such person's contribution’ to be overbroad and unduly
burdensome, and sustains the objection to that part of the interrogatory”); In re Urethane

                                              3
Antitrust Litig., No. 04-MD-1616-JWL-DJW, 2008 WL 110896, at *1 (D. Kan. Jan. 8,
2008) (holding that a discovery request is overly broad and unduly burdensome on its
face if it uses an “omnibus term” such as “relating to,” because “such broad language
‘make[s] arduous the task of deciding which of numerous documents may conceivably
fall within its scope’”); Roda Drilling Co. v. Siegal, No. 07-CV-400-GFK-FHM, 2008
WL 2234652, at *2 (N.D. Okla. May 29, 2008) (finding that “many of the parties’
requests for production of documents are overbroad, as they request ‘all documents'
relating to or concerning a subject”), reconsideration denied in part, 2008 WL 3892067
(N.D. Okla. Aug. 14, 2008); Cotracom Commodity Trading Co. v. Seaboard Corp., 189
F.R.D. 655, 665 (D. Kan. 1999) (holding that challenged discovery request was facially
overbroad due to its use of the “omnibus phrase ‘relating to’”); Parsons v. Jefferson-Pilot
Corp., 141 F.R.D. 408, 412 (M.D.N.C. 1992) (“[b]road and undirected requests for all
documents which relate in any way to the complaint are regularly stricken as too
ambiguous”).
       And, Plaintiff has expanded the dictionary definition of “relate” in her definition
section to make any attempt at deciding what documents might fall within the requests
impossible.
       Respectfully, this is an issue that should be discussed by professional counsel to
attempt to craft a meaningful request, if possible. Here, no attempt has been made by
Plaintiff to do so.
       In light of the many areas in which a compromise could be reached between the
parties, Plaintiff cannot claim her attempt to confer with Ms. Maxwell’s counsel would
have been futile. C.f. Alexander Interactive, Inc. v. Adorama, Inc., No. 12 CIV. 6680
PKC JCF, 2013 WL 6283511, at * 3 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 4, 2013) (recognizing that the merits
of a discovery motion may be addressed despite a failure to confer where the papers
submitted by the parties “indicate[d] that both sides have dug in-indeed… Ordering the
parties to meet and confer is unlikely to resolve these disputes.”). Similarly, because this
case is in its relatively early stages (Ms. Maxwell has yet to answer the Complaint) there
are no temporal exigencies that would require immediate action. C.f. In re NASDAQ

                                             4
Market-Makers Antitrust Litig., No. 94 Civ. 3996 (RWS), 1996 WL 187409, at *
(S.D.N.Y. April 18, 1996) (J. Sweet) (finding the failure to meet and confer was
mitigated by “the imminence of the deadlines for filing of papers relating to the class
certification motion…”).
II.    PLAINTIFF’S COMPLAINT THAT MS. MAXWELL DID NOT “SUBMIT
       EVIDENCE” TO SUPPORT HER CLAIMS OF PRIVILEGE IS
       PREMATURE

       In support of her Motion to Compel Documents Subject to Improper Claim of
Privilege, Plaintiff argues that Ms. Maxwell failed to satisfy her burden of establishing
privilege because she did not submit “competent evidence, usually through affidavits,
deposition testimony, or other admissible evidence.” Mot. Compel Priv. at 3. This
argument is premature.
      The established practice in this Court is for the party to challenge an assertion of
privilege, after which the burden shifts to the withholding party to come forward with
evidence establishing the elements of the applicable privilege or protection. See Veleron
Holding, B.V. v. BNP Paribas SA,No. 12-CV-5966 CM RLE, 2014 WL 4184806, at *2
(S.D.N.Y. Aug. 22, 2014) (“Once an assertion of privilege is challenged, the withholding
party must ‘submit evidence…establishing only the challenged elements of the applicable
privilege or protection, with the ultimate burden of proof resting with the party asserting
the privilege or protection.’”) (quoting A.I.A. Holdings, S.A. v. Lehman Bros. Inc., 97-
CV-4978 (LMM), 2002 WL 31385824, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 21, 2002)). Indeed, the
conferral process is exactly when the burden would shift to the withholding party. Thus,
the Motion to Compel should be denied as premature and Ms. Maxwell should be
afforded an opportunity to meet her burden.
       For the foregoing reasons, Ms. Maxwell respectfully requests that the Court deny
Plaintiff’s Motions to Compel and order the parties to meet and confer in good faith, as
required under Rule 26(a)(1). Ms. Maxwell also respectfully requests permission to refile
her response to Plaintiff’s Motions in the event the conferral is unsuccessful.
