 1          Q.    Okay.    And Ghislaine Maxwell, you are
 2   aware, is involved in litigation with Virginia
 3   Roberts right now, correct?
 4          A.    She is being sued by Virginia Roberts for
 5   defamation, not for the underlying offenses, which
 6   are beyond the statute of limitations, as I
 7   understand it, correct.
 8          Q.    And have you spoken with Ghislaine Maxwell
 9   about the allegations against her and her denials?
10                MR. INDYKE:      Same objection, same
11          instruction.
12                MR. SCOTT:      Don't answer it.      It's

15          Q.     I'm asking about your conversations with
16   Ghislaine Maxwell, who's in a separate litigation,
17   civil litigation for defamation.            Have you
18   personally spoken with Ghislaine Maxwell since these
19   allegations?
20          A.    If there's no objection, I will answer.
21                MR. INDYKE:      There was an objection.           Same
22          objection, same instruction.
23      BY MR. EDWARDS:
24          Q.    Is there a joint defense agreement related

 1   defamation actions that involve Ghislaine Maxwell
 2   and yourself?
 3                MR. INDYKE:      Same objection.
 4                SPECIAL MASTER POZZUOLI:         What's the
 5          basis -- can you explain to me what the basis
 6          of the objection is -- and what was the
 7          question?
 8                MR. EDWARDS:      Has Mr. Dershowitz spoken
 9          with Ghislaine Maxwell since the allegations --
10          since this defamation suit came about as well
11          as the defamation suit with Ghislaine Maxwell.
12      BY MR. EDWARDS:
13          Q.    Let me ask it cleaner.         Have you spoken
14   with Ghislaine Maxwell since January 2015?
15                MR. INDYKE:      Same objection, same
16          instruction.
17      BY MR. EDWARDS:
18          Q.    So that I'm clear, there is a joint
19   defense of the allegations regarding Ghislaine
20   Maxwell that's New York litigation and this
21   defamation case?
22                MR. INDYKE:      There's a common interest
23          agreement in effect with respect to the
24          New York case and a common interest agreement
25          with respect to this case.

 7          Q.    Is there a common interest agreement in

 9   arisen since January of 2015 or that you contend
10   covers that?

19          pushed me, so I let you go.
20                MR. SCAROLA:      Can we have a ruling as to
21          whether we get to know whether Mr. Dershowitz
22          is a party to a common interest agreement with

 1          McCawley, if any of the individuals on the
 2          phone are representing Ghislaine Maxwell, my
 3          understanding is the person on the phone is
 4          representing Jeffrey Epstein, not Ghislaine
 5          Maxwell.     That needs to be clarified.
 6                  MR. INDYKE:    Correct.     Correct.
 7                  SPECIAL MASTER POZZUOLI:       The answer is
 8          correct?
 9                  MR. INDYKE:    With respect to Mr. Epstein,
10          I can tell you there's a common interest
11          agreement with respect to this matter and a
12          common interest agreement with respect to the
13          Ghislaine Maxwell suit in New York.
14                  SPECIAL MASTER POZZUOLI:       Is
15          Mr. Dershowitz party to that?
16                  MR. INDYKE:    Mr. Dershowitz is party to a
17          common interest agreement with Jeffrey in this
18          case.     And I believe -- I'd have to check, but
19          I believe that that would extend --
20                  MR. SCAROLA:    We want an answer from the
21          witness as to whether the witness is a party to

23          Maxwell.

 2      BY MR. EDWARDS:
 3          Q.    Are you a party to a common interest
 4   agreement with Ghislaine Maxwell?
 5          A.    If there's no objection, I'll answer it.
 6                MR. INDYKE:      I apologize.      I thought we
 7          were still operating under the original set of
 8          objections.     So I will repeat it.        Same
 9          objection, same instruction.
10                SPECIAL MASTER POZZUOLI:         With respect to
11          that question, you can answer.
12          A.    My understanding is that I am still
13   Jeffrey Epstein's lawyer.          Jeffrey Epstein, I
14   understand, has a common interest or joint defense
15   agreement with Ghislaine Maxwell, so I have -- my
16   understanding is that I am bound by a common
17   agreement.
18      BY MR. EDWARDS:
19          Q.    Is this the same common interest agreement
20   that we were talking about from 2005, or is this a
21   separate common interest agreement that has been
22   signed as a consequence of the lawsuits that have
23   been filed since January 2015?
24                MR. INDYKE:      If this is a new question,
25          I'll assert the same objection and the same

 1         instruction.
 2                 SPECIAL MASTER POZZUOLI:        And I'm going to
 3         overrule the objection.         And you can answer
 4         that.
 5         A.      My understanding is that it's a
 6   combination; that is, it reflects the previous
 7   agreement and that there is a new agreement that
 8   supplemented the previous agreement.
 9      BY MR. EDWARDS:
10         Q.      When you say it's your understanding, is
11   this understanding in writing; meaning, is there a
12   written common interest agreement that has been put
13   in place since January of 2015?
14         A.      I don't know.

17                 MR. SCOTT:    Can we take a recess when we
18         get a chance?

20         going to instruct you --
21         A.      I don't know.     I don't know the answer to
22   that, whether there's additional writing or not.
