           19           Q. The book of policies that you mentioned that        19   she took all the pictures all over.
           20       was there by the time you left, I just wanted to           20      Q. Did you ever observe her doing a photo shoot

            1          A. Young woman?                                        1   V.R.? Obviously the tape preserves it. We're not
            2          Q. Yes.                                                2   asking the tape gentleman to edit it.
            3          A. No, I can't remember. I know that she went          3       MS. EZELL: Right.
            4       out and took pictures in the pool because later on I      4       MR. BERGER: So how is it preserved that V.R.
            5       would see them at the desk or at the house.               5   means your client's full name?
            6              And nude -- 99.9 percent of the time they were     6       MS. EZELL: Well, we had just agreed in
            7       topless. They were European girls. They were --           7   previous depositions that that's the way it would
            8          Q. You stated that you believe V.'s name was P.,       8   read. The written transcript would not have the
            9       but you weren't sure?                                     9   full name, but would just have the initials.
           10          A. Not sure.                                          10       MR. BERGER: I'm not so sure that constitutes
           11          Q. Could it have been R.?                             11   an identification by Mr. Alessi that's going to be
           12          A. R., yeah. Yeah. Could have been.                   12   clear. But this is the first deposition I've
           13          Q. I want to show you a picture and have it           13   attended, so I'm not sure if I'm -- if what I'm
           14       marked as an Exhibit to this deposition.                 14   saying has been dealt with or not.
           15              MS. EZELL: And did we have the agreement          15       MR. MERMELSTEIN: I think we're working on
           16          beforehand that we've been having all along that      16   good faith. Mr. Critton is agreeing that the
           17          we're just using initials and not names?              17   name -- and I don't think anyone's going to come
           18              MR. WILLITS: My client has waived the             18   back later and say, oh, you meant Vince Robinson or
           19          confidentiality as to herself. But I certainly        19   anything like that, so...
           20          agree as to everybody else.                           20       MR. BERGER: Well, I'm not -- I'm not talking
           21              MR. LANGINO: As do I.                             21   about Mr. Critton. Bob Critton I have the full
           22              MS. EZELL: Is that okay?                          22   trust in. I'm just talking about a jury watching
           23              MR. CRITTON: That's what we agreed to on the      23   this or reading this transcript believing that
           24          last.                                                 24   Mr. Alessi has accurately identified one of these
           25              MS. EZELL: Right.                                 25   victims. That's all. I don't know if you've all

            1              MR. CRITTON: For the court reporter, at            1   thought about that.
            2          least, in terms of the -- I guess in terms of the      2       MS. EZELL: Well, for one thing, the jury
            3          transcript she gives to us, if you would just use a    3   might, if they're -- if they're hearing or reading
            4          first initial and a last initial.                      4   his testimony, they most likely would be seeing the
            5              MR. WILLITS: So when you ask about V., it          5   video, which would have the full name. Unless the
            6          would be V.R. is what the court reporter would         6   Judge allows us to block out names and we haven't
            7          write down?                                            7   come to that point.
            8              MS. EZELL: Right.                                  8       MR. MERMELSTEIN: I think the idea at trial,
            9              MR. CRITTON: But make sure everybody uses the      9   V.R., if it's read to the jury would become then
           10          full name, because that way we'll have two            10   V.R. It would be read as V.R. But if it's filed
           11          initials.                                             11   with the Court, this transcript, it will be V.R.,
           12              MR. WILLITS: When they speak, but she's going     12   and that way it doesn't have to be redacted.
           13          to write it down as initials. Is that what you're     13       MR. WILLITS: As I also understood it, if
           14          saying? I'm confused about everything.                14   there would be any question at all, we could simply
           15              MR. CRITTON: The reason is, is there may be       15   ask the court reporter and she would say, according
           16          25, you know, there may be three V.s. So if you       16   to my notes, V.R. is Virgil Robinson and not -- or
           17          just mention V. and it just shows up as a V., it      17   whatever her notes show. Wouldn't she be the final
           18          won't make sense. So ergo you need to do that.        18   authority?
           19          But Carolyn Andriano, his client, she gets the        19       MS. EZELL: Well, she would certainly have
           20          whole megillah.                                       20   that record.
           21              MR. WILLITS: Right.                               21       MR. CRITTON: You could listen to the tape.
           22              MR. BERGER: How is it preserved that we're        22   It would be pretty easy. I think we're making it a
           23          talking about your client? You gave her full name     23   lot more complicated than it need be.
           24          a minute ago. How is it preserved if she's -- the     24       MR. WILLITS: For once, I agree.
           25          court reporter is going to change the full name to    25       MR. CRITTON: I think it will be all right.
