 Accused Epstein ‘madam’ quietly selling townhouse
 By Emily Smith                                                                                                          February 2, 2015 | 9:38pm



                                                       Ghislaine Maxwell is quietly selling her New York townhouse on East 65th Street amid
                                                       renewed gossip about her relationship with disgraced mogul Jeffrey Epstein.

                                                       Maxwell’s been accused of acting as a “madam” and “procuring girls” for wealthy sex
                                                       offender Epstein — claims that she strongly denies.

                                                       Her home’s said to be nearly 7,000 square feet and was reportedly purchased in 2010
                                                       by an attorney with long-standing links to Epstein.




                                                       Now, sources tell Page Six, “Ghislaine is putting the word out to her wealthy friends
                                                       that she is ready to sell,” and wants more than $20 million.

                                                       Her rep didn’t comment.
