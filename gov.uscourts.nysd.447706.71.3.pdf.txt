Virginia L. Giuffre,

               Plaintiff,                             Case No.: 15-cv-07433-RWS

v.

Ghislaine Maxwell,

            Defendant.
________________________________/


           PLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE AND OBJECTIONS TO DEFENDANT’S
              FIRST SET OF DISCOVERY REQUESTS TO PLAINTIFF

         Plaintiff hereby serves her responses and objections to Defendant’s First Set of

Discovery Requests.

                                   GENERAL OBJECTIONS

       Defendant’s First Set of Discovery Requests violates Local Civil Rule 33.3. Defendant

has served interrogatories that are in direct violation of that Rule because the interrogatories are

not “restricted to those seeking names of witnesses with knowledge of information relevant to

the subject matter of the action, the computation of each category of damage alleged, and the

existence, custodian, location and general description of relevant documents, including pertinent

insurance agreements, and other physical evidence, or information of a similar nature.” Local

Civil Rule 33.3(a). Instead, they seek information under subsections (b) and (c) of Local Civil

Rule 33.3, and therefore, they should not be served because they are not “a more practical

method of obtaining the information sought than a request for production or a deposition,” and

because they were served in advance of the period “30 days prior to the discovery cut-off date.”

Local Civil Rule 33.3(b), (c). The interrogatories you served violate Local Rule 33.3 and we ask


                                                  1
       Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 71-3 Filed 03/23/16 Page 3 of 40



that you immediately withdraw those interrogatories. See Rule 33.3, Local Rules for the

Southern District of New York; see also Shannon v. New York City Transit Auth., No. 00 CIV.

5079 (Sweet, J.), 2001 WL 286727, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 22, 2001); accord Gary Friedrich

Enterprises, LLC v. Marvel Enterprises, Inc., No. 08 CIV. 1533 BSJ JCF, 2011 WL 1642381, at

*4 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 26, 2011). Specifically, Rule 33.3 provides:

       (a)     Unless otherwise ordered by the Court, at the commencement of discovery,
               interrogatories will be restricted to those seeking names of witnesses with
               knowledge of information relevant to the subject matter of the action, the
               computation of each category of damage alleged, and the existence, custodian,
               location and general description of relevant documents, including pertinent
               insurance agreements, and other physical evidence, or information of a similar
               nature.

       (b)     During discovery, interrogatories other than those seeking information described
               in paragraph (a) above may only be served (1) if they are a more practical method
               of obtaining the information sought than a request for production or a deposition,
               or (2) if ordered by the Court.

       (c)     At the conclusion of other discovery, and at least 30 days prior to the discovery
               cut-off date, interrogatories seeking the claims and contentions of the opposing
               party may be served unless the Court has ordered otherwise.

       Similarly, Requests for Production numbers 1, 2, 4, 6(i), 9, 12, 30, 35 and 37 also violate

Local Rule 33.3 in that they rely on the offending interrogatory requests. The Rule provides that

a party must first try to obtain discovery through document production and testimony. Discovery

does not close in this case until July 1, 2016, and Defendant has not yet noticed a deposition. As

such, these interrogatories violate Local Rule 33.3 and are premature.

       Defendant’s First Set of Discovery Requests also violates Rule 33, Fed. R. Civ. P., which

provides “a party may serve on any other party no more than 25 interrogatories, including all

discrete subparts” – in that Defendant has served a total of 59 interrogatories, including subparts,

in violation of Rule 33. We ask that you immediately withdraw those interrogatories that exceed

the 25 interrogatory limit set by Rule 33.

       Ms. Giuffre objects to Defendant’s First Set of Discovery Requests to the extent they

seek information that is protected by any applicable privilege, including but not limited to,

attorney client privilege, work product privilege, joint defense/common interest privilege, agency

privilege, investigative privilege, spousal privilege, doctor/patient privilege, accountant/client

privilege, and any other applicable privilege.

       Ms. Giuffre objects to the requests to the extent Defendant’s First Set of Discovery

Requests call for the production of documents or information that is already in the possession,

custody, or control of the Defendant. Ms. Giuffre further objects to the requests to the extent that

Defendant’s First Set of Discovery Requests is duplicative of documents and information that

can equally or more readily be obtained by the Defendant.

       Ms. Giuffre objects to the requests to the extent that they seek documents that are not

relevant, material, or necessary to this action and, thus, are not reasonably calculated to lead to

the discovery of admissible evidence. Many of the requests in the Defendant’s First Set of

Discovery seek documents that are in no way limited to their relation to this case. Indeed, they

seek documents that are not important to resolving the issues; documents that are not relevant to

any party’s claim or defense; and documents that are not proportional to the needs of the case.

Such requests create a heavy burden on Ms. Giuffre that outweighs any benefit. Such discovery

is prohibited by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, particularly under the 2015 amendments to

Rule 26(b)(1), Fed. R. Civ. P., and is wholly inappropriate.

       Ms. Giuffre objects to the requests to the extent that they are overly broad and unduly

burdensome, as individually logging all privileged responsive documents would be overly

burdensome. Plaintiff contends that requests targeting such privileged information are overly

broad under Rule 26(b)(1), Fed. R. Civ. P. Specifically, Ms. Giuffre objects to the requests as




                                                  3
       Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 71-3 Filed 03/23/16 Page 5 of 40



overly burdensome to the extent that they would require logging voluminous and ever-increasing

privileged communications between Ms. Giuffre and her counsel after the date litigation

commenced on September 21, 2015. Ms. Giuffre objects to the requests as overly burdensome to

the extent that they would require logging voluminous privileged documents between Ms.

Giuffre and her counsel related to Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 v. United States, Case no. 08-

80736-CIV-Marra, pending in the Southern District of Florida; Bradley Edwards and Paul

Cassell v. Alan Dershowitz, Case no. CACE 15-000072, pending in the Seventeenth Judicial

Circuit, Broward County, Florida; and Jane Doe No. 102 v. Jeffrey Epstein, Case No. 09-80656-

CIV-Marra/Johnson (Southern District of Florida). Accordingly, due the undue burden of

individually logging responsive privileged documents related to Defendant’s overly broad

requests, Plaintiff has employed categorical logging of such privileged responsive documents

pursuant to Local Civil Rule 26.2(c).

       Ms. Giuffre objects to the requests in that they seek to invade her privacy for the sole

purpose of harassing and intimidating Ms. Giuffre who was a victim of sexual trafficking. Ms.

Giuffre objects to the requests to the extent they are overly broad and unduly burdensome.

       Ms. Giuffre objects to Defendant’s definition of “your attorneys” because it includes

names of attorneys that do not represent her, including Spencer Kuvin and Jack Scarola.

       Ms. Giuffre’s responses to Defendant’s First Set of Discovery Requests are being made

after reasonable inquiry into the relevant facts, and are based only upon the information and

documentation that is presently known to her. Ms. Giuffre reserves the right to modify and/or

supplement her responses. Ms. Giuffre is producing documents and information herewith, and

she will continue to review and produce relevant documents until completion.

       Ms. Giuffre incorporates her above-listed general objections in the responses herein.

               d.       the other Persons who lived with You at each address and for what period

                        of time they lived at such address.

Response to Interrogatory One:

       Ms. Giuffre objects to this interrogatory in part because it violates Rule 33.3. Ms.

Giuffre objects to this interrogatory in that it seeks information that is sought by Defendant only

to harass and intimidate Ms. Giuffre who was a victim of sexual trafficking.

               a.       Due to safety concerns with respect to Ms. Giuffre and her minor children,

                        she is not at liberty to reveal her present residential location. To ensure that

                        Defendant is not prejudiced by the failure to provide information about Ms.

                        Giuffre’s specific residential location, Ms. Giuffre agrees to have her

                        attorney’s accept service on her behalf of any necessary communication or

                        filings in this matter to be addressed to: Sigrid McCawley, Esq. Boies

                        Schiller & Flexner LLP, 401 East Las Olas Blvd., Suite 1200, Fort

                        Lauderdale, FL 33316.

               b.       Ms. Giuffre can recall living at the following addresses during the period of

                        1998 to the present. Ms. Giuffre may have lived at other locations for which

                        she does not presently have the address. Ms. Giuffre is providing the




                                                     5

               Austrich and a few other individuals for whom Ms. Giuffre cannot

               recall the names of, stayed with her from time to time at the residence

               that Jeffrey Epstein rented.

dates of any such representation, and the nature of the representation.

Response to Interrogatory No. 3

               a.    the exact false statement;

               b.    the date of its publication;

               e.    the nature of the publication, whether in print, internet, broadcast or some

                     other form of media.

Response to Interrogatory No. 6

        Ms. Giuffre objects to this interrogatory in that it violates Local Rule 33.3. Ms.

Giuffre objects in that it seeks information protected by the attorney-client privilege, the

attorney work product privilege, joint defense/common interest privilege, the agency

privilege, investigative privilege, spousal privilege, accountant client privilege, and any other

applicable privilege. Ms. Giuffre further objects because the information requested above is

in the possession of Defendant who has failed to comply with her production obligations in

this matter.

        7.     State whether You believe that You have ever been defamed by anyone other than

Ghislaine Maxwell. If so, as to each alleged act of Defamation, state

               a.    the exact false statement;

               b.    the date of its publication;
