                  Re:   Virginia Giuffre v. Maxwell
                        Case No. 15-cv-07433-RWS

        Dear Judge Sweet:

                Counsel for Ms. Giuffre inadvertently filed a confidential document as Exhibit 4 to Docket
        Entry 79. In order to rectify the error, counsel for Ms. Giuffre spoke with an employee with the
        ECF help desk who instructed us to inform the Court via letter that he placed a temporary seal on
        Exhibit 4 to Docket Entry 79, Declaration of Sigrid S. McCawley, pursuant to this Court's
        Protective Order (Docket Entry 62). Thank you for your consideration and my apologies for the
        error.

                                                      Sincerely,



                                                      Sigrid S. Mccawley
